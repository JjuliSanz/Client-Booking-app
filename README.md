# Full-Stack Booking Clone App

In this project, I create a clone of the popular booking platform. The backend is built using Node.js and Express.js, which provide a scalable and efficient server-side infrastructure. I use MongoDB, a NoSQL database, to store and manage data related to bookings, users, accommodations, and other relevant information. The backend API handles user authentication, booking creation and management, and communication with the database. On the frontend, we use React, a powerful JavaScript library, to build a dynamic and interactive user interface. Users can browse accommodations, search for available dates, view details, and make bookings. React components handle rendering, state management, and user interactions. I utilize React Router to enable routing and navigation within the application.
